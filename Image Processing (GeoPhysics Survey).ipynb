    "## Image Processing: Obtaining resistivity data in HEXCODE from Geophysics data (image)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Why This Notebook?\n",
    "In geophysics, **terrameter readings** provide valuable insights into subsurface resistivity. However, in this case, the raw numerical data is unavailable‚ÄîI only have **images** of these readings extracted from presentation slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç The Manual Process\n",
    "Normally, I would:\n",
    "1. **Manually extract color values** from the images.\n",
    "2. **Cross-check each color** against a resistivity scale/legend.\n",
    "3. **Manually enter resistivity values** into a GIS attribute table.\n",
    "4. **Generate depth-based resistivity rasters** in GIS using multiple cross-sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be **slow, repetitive, and tedious**, especially when working with multiple images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üöÄ What This Notebook Does\n",
    "To **automate** the process, this script:\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Reads the **terrameter image** and overlays a structured **grid**.  \n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Extracts the **most common color** in each grid cell.  \n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Converts colors to **HEX values** for easy processing.  \n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Saves the extracted color data in a structured format (**CSV & Excel heatmap**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps\n",
    "- Use **coordinate data (X, Y, Z)** to georeference the extracted values.  \n",
    "- Replace **HEX colors** with actual **resistivity values** using the legend from terrameter reading + interpretations of what they mean.  \n",
    "- Integrate the processed data into **GIS** to generate resistivity-based depth rasters from multiple cross-sections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By automating this **first step**, I can **significantly speed up** the process of converting image-based terrameter readings into **usable geospatial data**."
